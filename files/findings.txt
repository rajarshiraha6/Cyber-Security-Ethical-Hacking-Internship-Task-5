Title — Exploitation & Evidence
Date: 2025-11-12
Author: Rajarshi Raha

1) Lab setup
- Attacker (Kali): 192.168.56.102
- Target (Metasploitable2 / DVWA): 192.168.56.101
- Network: Host-only

2) Recon summary
- Ping to target: SUCCESS (4 packets received)
- Nmap high-level: open ports found: 21 (ftp), 22 (ssh), 80 (http), 3306 (mysql)
- Noted service versions: vsftpd ? (banner not confirmed), Apache 2.2.x

3) Exploitation attempts
- Module used: exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor (Metasploit)
- Command & settings:
  - set RHOSTS 192.168.56.101
  - set RPORT 21
  - set VERBOSE true
  - spool enabled to save msf output
- Result: `Exploit completed, but no session was created.`  
  - Additional message: `Rex::HostUnreachable` observed → indicates connectivity or service reachability issues at time of exploitation.

4) Evidence collected
- Ping output: ~/task5/scans/ping_19216856_101_20251112_101500.log
- Nmap port scan: ~/task5/scans/nmap_port21_20251112_101520.log
- Netcat banner attempt: ~/task5/scans/nc_21_banner_20251112_101530.log
- Metasploit spool: ~/task5/notes/msf_spool_20251112_101540.log

5) Analysis / Reasons exploit failed
- Port 21 may have been filtered or temporarily unreachable.
- Target may not be running vsftpd 2.3.4 (exploit only works for that version).
- Reverse connection from payload may have been blocked by firewall or wrong LHOST setting.

6) Mitigation / Recommendations
- Ensure target services are patched (patch vsftpd or remove vulnerable version).
- Harden network rules and only allow necessary services.
- For lab: verify service versions before running exploit modules.

7) Next steps
- Re-run `nmap -sV` and `nc` to confirm FTP banner/version.
- If vsftpd 2.3.4 confirmed, ensure LHOST is set and try alternate payloads.
- Try other discovered vectors (e.g., HTTP vulnerabilities) if FTP is not vulnerable.
